## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- CSS Flexbox;
- CSS Grid;
- Mobile-first workflow;
- Responsive webpage;

### What I learned

- (HTML) proper nameing scheem;
- (HTML) proper HTML structure;
- (HTML) when to use button element;
- (CSS) change font-size for bigger screen using media querys by appling bigger value than 100% on the whole Html page;
- (CSS) grid auto rows property -> to set default row dimensions (max-content - depends on the largest element)
- (CSS) flex-flow: column nowrap; property -> shorthand for 'flex-direction' and 'flex-wrap' properties;
- (CSS) flex: 1 0 auto -> shorthand for (flex-grow: 0; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: auto;);
- (CSS) ".activity_bg > img" -> new way of targeting child element in parent element;

### Continued development

- Can implement JS into the project, that will pull data and update the time.
